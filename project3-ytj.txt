Project 3: ytj

Due date: Thursday, 11/29, 11:59pm 


====== OVERVIEW ======

Write a script called ytj (youtube jukebox).

  - The ytj script takes one argument string and searches youtube.com
    using the argument string, e.g. $ ytj "don knuth lecture"

  - Using the first page of search results returned by
    youtube.com, ytj will download and play (audio only) the
    videos in the search results

        - This will require ytj to perform these tasks: 1) search
          youtube for videos based on the search string; 2) download
          the youtube videos in the search results as files; 3) play
          the files (audio only)

            - Tasks 2 (download) and 3 (play) have to happen in parallel.
                - Soon (say 10 seconds) after the first youtube
                  file has begun to be downloaded, a nohup'ed
                  mplayer process should start in the background
                  to play all the youtube files in the download
                  list. (mplayer can play an incomplete youtube
                  file that is still being downloaded).

                  - The nohup method to start a command chain is needed:

                        nohup bash -c "command1; command2; ..." &

                - While mplayer is silently playing in the
                  background, ytj will be downloading the videos
                  in the foreground, displaying the progress of
                  each download.

        - Some of the youtube search results may be playlists or
          channels. Just skip the playlists and channels, or taylor
          your youtube search to exclude playlists and channels.
          Download and play only search results that are youtube
          videos.

        - See additional sections below for more details.




====== SYNOPSIS ======

  - ytj command line options:
    -h: display a usage statement (also displayed if ytj is called with no
        arguments)
    -k: keep downloaded video files (default behavior is to delete all
        downloaded video files after they have been played.
    -l: (I'm feeling *l*ucky) download and play only the
        first search result. (EXTRA CREDIT, +5%) 


  

====== STORAGE ======

  - All video files downloaded will be saved to a directory whose name
    is based on the ytj search argument. So, if the ytj search argument is
    "the avalanches", videos will be downloaded to the directory called
    "the_avalanches".
    - If the user chooses not to not to keep the downloaded video files,
      then just delete that directory upon script exit.





====== TOOLS ======

  - Tools needed:  - wget (search youtube)
                   - The usual cast of UNIX text processing utilities
                      - extract needed info from wget
                   - yt (script developed in class to download and play
                     youtube videos)
                      - use yt to only download, not play
                   - mplayer (play video files)






====== SEARCHING YOUTUBE ======

  - Searching youtube and similar sites isn't that hard
    - Examples of valid search URLs:
        http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=don+knuth+lecture
        http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+avalanches
    - ytj should handle invalid searches like the following by
      exiting with a message, such as "No video results for
      'kdon nuth lecture'":
        http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kdon+nuth+lecture

  - Optionally, see Google's Youtube API Developer's Guide (h/t:
    James F.):
    http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_api_query_parameters.html
    - Using the Youtube API for video querying will make the ytj
      script easier to maintain in the future.
